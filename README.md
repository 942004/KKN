# Digit Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Description
This project implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier** to recognize handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. It uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **confusion matrix analysis** to evaluate performance.

## Features
- Utilizes **scikit-learn's KNN classifier** for digit recognition.
- Implements **PCA** for feature reduction and visualization.
- Uses **matplotlib and seaborn** for graphical representation of results.
- Evaluates model performance using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook Untitled9.ipynb
```
